All fields must be entered for the appointment to be submitted, or you will see an error alert message. Additionally, date format (mm/dd/yyyy) and time format (eg. 12:30pm) are validated before an appointment can be submitted. 

To update your created appointment, click the update icon button and make any necessary changes.

To delete your appointment, simply click the delete icon button.

To clear all appointments, click the button at the bottom of the page saying "clear appointments".
